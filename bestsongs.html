    <h2>Don't Look Back in Anger</h2>
    <p>Slip inside the eye of your mind</p>
    <p>Don't you know you might find</p>
    <p>All the places where you went wrong</p>
    <p>And you said that you’d never leave</p>
    <p>But you can’t just sit and grieve</p>
    <p>So I start a revolution from my bed</p>
    <p>Because you said the brains I had went to my head</p>
    <p>Step outside, summertime's in bloom</p>
    <p>Stand up beside the fireplace</p>
    <p>Take that look from off your face</p>
    <p>You ain't never gonna burn my heart out</p>
    <p>And so Sally can wait,</p>
    <p>She knows it's too late as we're walking on by</p>
    <p>Her soul slides away,</p>
    <p>But don't look back in anger</p>
    <p>I heard you say</p>
    <p>Take me to the place where you go</p>
    <p>Where nobody knows if it's night or day</p>
    <p>Please don't put your life in the hands</p>
    <p>Of a Rock 'n Roll band</p>
    <p>Who'll throw it all away</p>
    <p>Gonna start the revolution from my bed</p>
    <p>'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head</p>
    <p>Step outside cos summertime's in bloom</p>
    <p>Stand up beside the fireplace</p>
    <p>Take that look from off your face</p>
    <p>'Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</p>
    <p>And so Sally can wait,</p>
    <p>She knows it's too late as she's walking on by</p>
    <p>My soul slides away,</p>
    <p>But don't look back in anger</p>
    <p>I heard you say</p>
    <p>So Sally can wait,</p>
    <p>She knows it's too late as we're walking on by</p>
    <p>Her soul slides away,</p>
    <p>But don't look back in anger</p>
    <p>I heard you say</p>
    <p>And so Sally can wait,</p>
    <p>She knows it's too late and she's walking on by</p>
    <p>My soul slides away,</p>

    <h2>Wonderwall</h2>
    <p>Today is gonna be the day</p>
    <p>That they're gonna throw it back to you</p>
    <p>By now you should've somehow</p>
    <p>Realized what you gotta do</p>
    <p>I don't believe that anybody</p>
    <p>Feels the way I do about you now</p>
    <p>Backbeat the word was on the street</p>
    <p>That the fire in your heart is out</p>
    <p>I'm sure you've heard it all before</p>
    <p>But you never really had a doubt</p>
    <p>I don't believe that anybody feels</p>
    <p>The way I do about you now</p>
    <p>And all the roads we have to walk along are winding</p>
    <p>And all the lights that lead us there are blinding</p>
    <p>There are many things that I would</p>
    <p>Like to say to you</p>
    <p>I don't know how</p>
    <p>Because maybe</p>
    <p>You're gonna be the one who saves me?</p>
    <p>And after all</p>
    <p>You're my wonderwall</p>
    <p>Today was gonna be the day?</p>
    <p>But they'll never throw it back to you</p>
    <p>By now you should've somehow</p>
    <p>Realized what you're not to do</p>
    <p>I don't believe that anybody</p>
    <p>Feels the way I do</p>
    <p>About you now</p>
    <p>And all the roads that lead to you were winding</p>
    <p>And all the lights that light the way are blinding</p>
    <p>There are many things that I would like to say to you</p>
    <p>I don't know how</p>
    <p>I said maybe</p>
    <p>You're gonna be the one who saves me?</p>
    <p>And after all</p>
    <p>You're my wonderwall</p>
    <p>I said maybe</p>
    <p>You're gonna be the one who saves me?</p>
    <p>And after all</p>
    <p>You're my wonderwall</p>
    <p>Said maybe</p>
    <p>You're gonna be the one that saves me</p>
    <p>You're gonna be the one that saves me</p>
    <p>You're gonna be the one that saves me</p>

    <h2>Whatever</h2>
    <p>I'm free to be whatever I</p>
    <p>Whatever I choose</p>
    <p>And I'll sing the blues if I want</p>
    <p>I'm free to say whatever I</p>
    <p>Whatever I like</p>
    <p>If it's wrong or right it's alright</p>
    <p>Always seems to me</p>
    <p>You only see what people want you to see</p>
    <p>How long's it gonna be</p>
    <p>Before we get on the bus</p>
    <p>And cause no fuss</p>
    <p>Get a grip on yourself</p>
    <p>It don't cost much</p>
    <p>Free to be whatever you</p>
    <p>Whatever you say</p>
    <p>If it comes my way it's alright</p>
    <p>You're free to be wherever you</p>
    <p>Wherever you please</p>
    <p>You can shoot the breeze if you want</p>
    <p>It always seems to me</p>
    <p>You only see what people want you to see</p>
    <p>How long's it gonna be</p>
    <p>Before we get on the bus</p>
    <p>And cause no fuss</p>
    <p>Get a grip on yourself</p>
    <p>It don't cost much</p>
    <p>I'm free to be whatever I</p>
    <p>Whatever I choose</p>
    <p>And I'll sing the blues if I want</p>
    <p>Here in my mind</p>
